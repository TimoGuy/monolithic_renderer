@TODO: It appears that actually writing a simple geom shader is the next step
(that would include the camera projectionview stuff). And then it should be clear what else is needed
to get to drawing the first scene.
    Maybe it could just be the simple missing material shader!! (Could just draw a color for now)

STAR HERTEEEE!!!
OKAY: so the next thing to do is finish the pipeline material creation boilerplate. (material_bank.cpp)
